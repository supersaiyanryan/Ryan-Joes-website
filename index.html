		<h2>When did my passion for streetwear, sneakers and fashion start?</h2>
		<p>I've always liked fashion and style when I was a kid! I started off with wearing surf and skate brands like, Ripcurl, Billabong and Quiksilver. While wearing these clothing brands the sneakers I was wearing with them were Vans and Element sneakers. I still remember one of my favourite sneakers when I was around 10 years old was the black Nike Janoskis they were so sick! Just the silhouette and the ability that you could pair the Janoskis with any piece of clothing was what I loved!</p> 


		<p> As I grew older I started to branch out more and stopped wearing the surfwear clothing brands and dived into more of the streetwear clothing. Brands like I love ugly and Stussy were my favourites at the time. My favourite hoodie I copped in Australia was a grey small logo stussy hoodie. I wore that hoodie til it had a rips and a hole in it! The brand I love ugly, a New Zealand streetwear brand for, "The Independant Mind" clicked with my taste in streetwear. My cousin got me into I love ugly, they made good high quality garments that satisfied my taste. I love ugly's pants are the best out of their clothes, they're very unique and distinct. My favourite I love ugly piece has to be their coach jacket I purchased in their Wellington flagship store. </p> 


		<p> As I continued to grow bigger, taller and older my taste in fashion began to grow into more fashion and streetwear labels. I started to turn into a, "hypebeast". A hypebeast may be defined as follows: "A person who follows a trend to be cool or in style." My first hypebeast item was the Yeezy 350 V2 in the "Oreo" colourway. I was luckily enough to be randomly selected in the adidas online que to purchase the Yeezy 350 V2 Oreo at the retail price of $390 NZD which would later turn into a resale value of $1100 AUD. After this first hypebeast purchase this was where I started to indulge myself into purchasing more hyped brands like, Supreme, A Bathing Ape and Palace.</p>


		<h2>Gaming since I was a kid</h2>
		<p>The very first gaming console I started on was the GameBoy Advanced. I played Pokemon Ruby and Emerald! I then moved onto the Nintendo DS Lite where I played alot of Pokemon Pearl and Mario Kart. Moving away from the Nintendo consoles, I got my first Xbox 360 console with Kinect. The first games I got was Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sport, Kung Fu Panda and Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2. As I got sick of the Kinect games I got started into the Call of Duty franchise where the first Call of Duty game I picked up was Modern Warfare 3. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was one of the best Call of Dutys as it was one of the most games I played ever and I met some amazing people on there that I still know to this date. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 was the next Call of Duty to release and it was just as good!</p>
