		<h2> Video games </h2>
		<p>The very first gaming console I started on was the GameBoy Advanced. I played Pokemon Ruby and Emerald! I then moved onto the Nintendo DS Lite where I played alot of Pokemon Pearl and Mario Kart. Moving away from the Nintendo consoles, I got my first Xbox 360 console with Kinect. The first games I got was Kinect Adventures, Kinect Sport, Kung Fu Panda and Dragon Ball Raging Blast 2. Moving away from these games I really got started into the Call of Duty franchise where the first Call of Duty game I picekd up was Modern Warfare 3. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 was one of the best Call of Dutys as it was one of the most games I played ever and I met some amazing people on there that I still know to this date. Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 was the next Call of Duty to release and it was just as good!</p>
